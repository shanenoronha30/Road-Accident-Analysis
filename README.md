# Road Accident Analytics Dashboard

## Project Overview

Road safety is a major issue impacting communities around the world. This project features a **Road Accident Analytics Dashboard**, a powerful tool designed to analyze and visualize road accident data for the years 2021 and 2022. Built in Excel, this dashboard enables stakeholders to gain valuable insights and make data-driven decisions to improve road safety.

## Tech Stack

- **Excel** (for Data Cleaning, Transformation, Analysis, and Visualization)

## Skills Showcased

- Data Cleaning
- Data Transformation
- Data Analysis
- Filtering, Sorting, and Conditional Functions
- Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts
- Data Visualization
- Dashboard Creation

## Project Requirements and KPIs

The dashboard was created with the following KPIs in mind:

### Primary KPIs
1. **Total Casualties** and **Total Accidents** for the current year and Year-over-Year (YoY) growth.
2. **Total Casualties by Accident Severity** for the current year and YoY growth.

### Secondary KPIs
1. **Total Casualties by Vehicle Type** for the current year.
2. **Monthly Casualty Trends** comparing the current year with the previous year.
3. **Casualties by Road Type** for the current year.
4. **Casualties by Area/Location** and **Day/Night Conditions** for the current year.
5. **Total Casualties and Accidents by Location**.

## Data Sourcing

The dataset used for this project can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R_uaoZL18nRbqC_MULVne90h3SdRbAyn/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=116890999875311477003&rtpof=true&sd=true).

## Data Cleaning and Transformation

The data cleaning and transformation process involved:

1. Checking for NULL values, blanks, and errors.
2. Removing duplicates and irrelevant columns.
3. Ensuring the data is consistent with correct data types, formats, and values.
4. Creating two new attributes: `Year` and `Month` for easier data interpretation.

## Data Analysis

The analysis was done on a separate **Data Analysis** sheet, summarizing the data with 9 pivot tables. These tables highlight trends based on various factors, such as:

- Casualty type
- Vehicle type
- Road type
- Location
- Month-to-month comparison for the years 2021 and 2022

## Data Visualization

After performing the analysis, I created the dashboard by inserting and customizing pivot charts based on the corresponding pivot tables. For an interactive user experience, slicers and timelines were added. Hyperlinks and connections were incorporated for easy navigation.

## Key Insights

- **Total Casualties Analysis:** 417,883 casualties occurred from accidents over the two-year period.
- **Peak Months:** October and November experienced the highest number of casualties in both years, while January and February had the lowest.
- **Casualties by Vehicle Type:** Cars accounted for 79.8% of the total casualties.
- **Casualties by Accident Severity:** 84.1% of casualties were classified as "Slight Severity," and only 1.7% were fatal.
- **Casualties by Road Type:** Single Carriageway roads had the highest casualties (310.1K), while Slip Roads had the lowest (5.1K).
- **Casualties by Road Surface:** 67% of casualties occurred on dry road surfaces.
- **Casualties by Location:** 61% of casualties occurred in urban areas.
- **Casualties by Light Condition:** 73% of casualties occurred during daylight hours.

## Recommendations Based on the Analysis

1. **High-Risk Periods (October-November):** Implement focused road safety measures during these high-risk months, based on peak casualty trends.
2. **Car Accidents:** Since cars are the leading vehicle type in accidents, target car drivers for awareness programs and safety checks.
3. **Single Carriageway Roads:** Prioritize safety measures and consider upgrading single carriageway roads to dual-lane roads to reduce casualties.
4. **Road Surface Maintenance:** Address areas with high casualty rates on dry surfaces by improving road maintenance and surface conditions.
5. **Urban Areas and Daylight:** Focus on improving safety in urban areas and during daylight hours, where the majority of accidents occur.

## Conclusion

The **Road Accident Analytics Dashboard** is a vital tool that helps stakeholders understand road safety data and make informed decisions to prevent accidents. The dashboard is useful for policymakers, traffic authorities, and safety advocates in planning interventions that can improve road safety and reduce casualties.
